##  Overview

I'm working on an ALPR system that can automatically detect and read license plates from images and videos in real-time. The goal is to create something that works well in different lighting conditions and camera angles - basically making it robust enough for real-world use.

This project tackles the challenge of automated vehicle identification, which has practical applications in parking management, traffic monitoring, and security systems.

##  Features

- **Real-time processing**: Works with live video feeds
- **Custom trained model**: Built using 11,776+ CCPD dataset images for high accuracy
- **Handles Chinese plates**: Specialized character recognition for Chinese license plates
- **Weather resistant**: Performs well across different lighting and environmental conditions
- **Modular design**: Easy to integrate into existing systems
- **Well documented**: Includes detailed exploration notebooks showing the development process

##  System Architecture

</p>

The system works in stages:
1. **Data Processing**: I explored and converted the CCPD dataset to YOLO format
2. **Detection Module**: Custom YOLOv8 model finds license plates in images
3. **Recognition Module**: EasyOCR extracts the actual text from detected plates
4. **Pipeline Integration**: Everything works together seamlessly
5. **User Interface**: Planning a Streamlit dashboard for easy interaction

##  Installation

### What you'll need
- Python 3.8 or higher
- A decent GPU helps (but not required - I optimized for CPU training too)
- At least 8GB RAM if you want to train from scratch

### Getting started

1. **Get the code**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/alpr-system.git
cd alpr-real-time
```


2. **Set up your environment**

```bash
python -m venv alpr_env
source alpr_env/bin/activate 
```


3. **Install everything**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


##  Usage

### Running license plate detection

```python
from src.detect_plate import LicensePlateDetector
# Setup the Detector
detector = LicensePlateDetector()

# Load the trained model
detector.load_model('models/license_plate_detection/best.pt')

# Detect plates in your image
results = detector.detect_plates('path/to/image.jpg')
```


### Exploring the dataset

```python
jupyter notebook notebooks/01_ccpd_exploration.ipynb
```
